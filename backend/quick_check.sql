-- 1. Count tables (should be 4)
SELECT COUNT(*) as tables_created 
FROM information_schema.tables

-- 2. Check RLS is enabled (all should show 't')

    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
    AND tablename IN ('users', 'user_stats', 'chat_history', 'user_achievements')

-- 3. Quick summary of all data
SELECT

    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_stats) as users_with_stats,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chat_history) as total_messages,

-- 7. Leaderboard (top users by points)
SELECT
